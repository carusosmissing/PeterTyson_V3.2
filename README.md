# TruEXP - Fan Engagement Platform

## Project Status for Technical Evaluation

TruEXP is a React Native mobile application designed for fan engagement and loyalty. This codebase contains a functionally complete frontend with prepared but unconnected backend service integrations. The application runs locally and demonstrates core functionality without requiring external services.

## Current Implementation State

### Frontend Implementation: Complete
- React Native 0.79.2 with Expo SDK 53
- TypeScript with strict configuration throughout
- Redux Toolkit state management with feature-based slices
- React Navigation v7 with stack and tab navigation
- Component library with 15+ reusable UI components
- Custom TrustubCarousel system with 3D animations and photo management
- Authentication screens and onboarding flow
- Local state persistence via AsyncStorage

### Backend Integration: Prepared but Disconnected
- Supabase client configuration exists but requires database setup
- Social platform API services (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Spotify) implemented but require OAuth app configuration
- Photo upload logic prepared for cloud storage integration
- Real-time messaging infrastructure ready but needs WebSocket connection

### What Functions Locally
- Complete navigation between 27+ screens
- Interactive TrustubCarousel with flip animations
- Photo capture and gallery management (device storage only)
- QR code generation for each trustub
- Form validation and state management
- Redux DevTools integration

### What Requires Backend Setup
- User authentication and registration
- Cloud photo storage and synchronization
- Social platform OAuth flows
- Real-time messaging
- Data persistence beyond local storage

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack Rationale

**Expo SDK 53**: Chosen for managed workflow deployment efficiency and cross-platform consistency. Enables OTA updates and reduces platform-specific configuration complexity.

**TypeScript**: Strict configuration provides compile-time error detection and improved maintainability for multi-developer teams. All interfaces and types are defined throughout the codebase.

**Redux Toolkit**: Implements predictable state management with RTK Query for data fetching. Feature-based slice architecture prevents monolithic state files and enables independent feature development.

**React Navigation v7**: Provides native performance through platform-specific navigation primitives with type-safe navigation parameters.

### Component Architecture

**Design System**: Implements atomic design principles with glassmorphism effects and gradient backgrounds. Components support variants for different visual styles and responsive sizing.

**TrustubCarousel**: Custom component implementing infinite scroll with triple data arrays, 3D flip animations using React Native Animated, photo management with camera/gallery integration, and QR code generation. State management handles flip states, photo galleries, and modal interactions for each card.

**State Management**: Redux slices organize state by feature (auth, user, onboarding, main, social). RTK Query is configured for API management with typed hooks (useAppSelector, useAppDispatch).

## Core Features Implementation

### TrustubCarousel System
- **Infinite Scroll**: Uses triple data array pattern for seamless looping
- **3D Flip Animation**: 180-degree Y-axis rotation with spring physics
- **Photo Management**: Camera integration via expo-image-picker with 4-column grid display
- **QR Code Generation**: Dynamic QR codes using react-native-qrcode-skia
- **Experience Notes**: Editable text areas with real-time updates
- **Performance**: 60fps scrolling with event throttling and hardware acceleration

### Authentication Flow
- Email-based registration and login forms with validation
- Password visibility controls and real-time form feedback
- Redux state management with AsyncStorage persistence
- Supabase integration prepared but requires database connection

### Onboarding System
- Branching logic based on user interest selection (Music, Sports, Both)
- 7-screen flow with conditional rendering
- State persistence through Redux with local storage backup
- Completed state tracking and progress indication

### Social Platform Integration
- Service classes for Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and Spotify APIs
- OAuth flow implementation with token management
- Unified platform manager for consistent interface across services
- UI components for connection status and management
- Deep linking configuration for OAuth callbacks (requires app registration)
